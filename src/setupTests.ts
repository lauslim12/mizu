// This file is not renamed to `setup-tests.ts` as this is only a default from Create React
// App to use Jest as its tests. Rather than changing the defaults, I'd rather keep them
// the same to prevent any unwanted side-effects.

// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// allows you to do things like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
